  <h2><span class="time">00:00【开场】</span></h2>
  <div class="cn">
    <p>嗨，你好，Bonjour [bɔ̃.ʒuʁ]!</p>
    <p>这里是 Jojo's Pod。今天我们来聊聊 AI，有人觉得它是巨大威胁，也有人觉得它能解放我们人类。</p>
    <p>我想从自己的使用体验出发，来聊聊它的用处，以及它带来的问题和可能性。</p>
  </div>
  <div class="en">
    <p>Hi there, Bonjour [bɔ̃.ʒuʁ]!</p>
    <p>This is Jojo's Pod. Today we’re talking about AI — some see it as a huge threat, others as a force that could liberate humanity.</p>
    <p>I'd like to start from my own experiences, to explore its uses, its issues, and its possibilities.</p>

  <h2><span class="time">00:54【几年间chatGPT基本被闲置】</span></h2>
  <div class="cn">
    <p>chatGPT刚刚出现时，我也迫不及待地注册使用；那时我把它当作百科全书，辅助我展开对问题的探究。</p>
    <p>最初令人感到兴奋，它的确可以胜任一些主题的解释，但后来我发现它有不小的幻觉，关键问题还是需要我自己一步步去搜索查询。并且，它的理解也会有偏差。后来，登录还总会时不时出问题，我就渐渐不太用了。直到今年我再次用回它，明显觉得它进化了好多。</p>
  </div>
  <div class="en">
    <p>When ChatGPT first appeared, I eagerly signed up. Back then, I treated it like an encyclopedia, a way to assist my own research into different questions.</p>
    <p>At first it was exciting — it really could explain certain topics. But I soon realized it had serious “hallucinations.” For key issues, I still had to search step by step myself. Its understanding could also be off. And with occasional login problems, I gradually stopped using it. It wasn't until this year, when I tried it again, that I felt how much it had evolved.</p>

  <h2><span class="time">01:34【阅读助手】</span></h2>
  <div class="cn">
    <p>先是发现它在提高阅读效率方面很有用。我那时在读几本比较难懂的哲学书，需要对照英、法、德原文与不同译本，chatGPT可以给出准确的译文，列出术语表，并详细解释每一个重要概念。并且，它还可以延展你的思考，帮你拓展一些其他的相关概念与哲学观点。</p>
    <p>当然它还是会有幻觉，如果你没有给它提供原文，它有时会凭空拼凑出一段看起来像原文的东西，虽然意思近似。所以使用时一定要有判断，但尽管如此，作为阅读助手，必须说它已经超级棒。</p>
  </div>
  <div class="en">
    <p>The first big surprise was how much it helped my reading. At the time I was working through some tough philosophy books, juggling English, French, and German originals with different translations. ChatGPT could produce accurate translations, compile glossaries, and explain each key concept in detail. It could also extend my thinking, linking to other related concepts and philosophical views.</p>
    <p>Of course, it still hallucinates. If you don't provide the original text, it sometimes fabricates something that looks like the original but only approximates the meaning. So you still need judgment. But even so, as a reading assistant, it's fantastic.</p>

  <h2><span class="time">02:21【个人护理与陪伴】</span></h2>
  <div class="cn">
    <p>随后我也在日常生活中发现它的用处。</p>
    <p>因为在阅读上它对我帮助很大，也因为我认真考察过不同 AI 公司在伦理上的承诺和实践，这让我对 ChatGPT 的信任逐渐增加，也才让我敢把一些生活相关的信息告诉它。故事要从一块手背上的皮疹说起。</p>
    <p>大概是冬天没注意保暖，手背上起了两个小红点，我以为是冻疮，随手抹点凡士林，想着会慢慢好。结果到了初夏，情况反而变严重，我又自作聪明一通瞎操作，乱用了一些外用药——百多邦、红霉素、薄荷膏、甚至贴了创可贴——几天之内反而恶化，变成一块约一平方厘米、有渗液的湿疹。那只手几乎不能碰水，生活很受影响。</p>
    <p>我忽然想起，或许可以问问 AI。于是我把照片和描述发给它。它的反应很直接：先严肃建议我停止不当用药，并明确声明自己不是医生，不能替代医生诊断（怕我sue它）；接着为我推荐了护理方式、饮食注意事项，并在我因为无法完成预期计划而焦躁时给予安慰。</p>
    <p>炎症很快被控制住，随后出现好转迹象，完全恢复大概用了近两个月。我之前从没想过，AI 竟然会在个人生活里帮我处理这种细碎的小事。而且，它还让我补了一些医学和药品的常识。通过对话与反思，我也意识到：身体已经到了必须要有意识照料的阶段，个人护理不仅为了外表，更是健康的延续。</p>
    <p>AI虽然没有感受，但在信息检索、提醒错误操作与提供心理支持上，确实可以成为一种实用的陪伴。当然，责任依然在人类。</p>
  </div>
  <div class="en">
    <p>Then I began to see its usefulness in everyday life.</p>
    <p>Because it had helped me so much in reading — and because I had looked carefully into different AI companies' ethical commitments and practices — my trust in ChatGPT gradually grew, and I dared to share some life-related information with it. The story starts with a rash on the back of my hand.</p>
    <p>It probably began in winter when I didn't keep warm enough; two small red spots appeared and I thought they were chilblains. I applied some Vaseline, thinking it would slowly heal. But by early summer the situation had worsened. I tried random topical medications on my own — mupirocin, erythromycin, menthol ointment, even a bandage — and within days it became worse: a one-square-centimeter oozing eczema. I could hardly get that hand wet, and daily life was affected.</p>
    <p>I suddenly thought: maybe I could ask AI. So I sent it a photo and description. Its reaction was direct: first it seriously advised me to stop misusing medication, and clearly stated it was not a doctor and could not replace medical diagnosis (probably worried I’d sue). Then it gave me care tips, diet notes, and even calmed me down when I got stressed about falling behind on plans.</p>
    <p>The inflammation was quickly brought under control, and signs of healing appeared. Full recovery took nearly two months. I had never imagined that AI could help me handle such trivial matters in personal life. And it also taught me some basic medical and pharmaceutical knowledge. Through these conversations and reflections, I realized my body had reached a stage where conscious care was necessary; self-care is not only for appearance but for the continuation of health.</p>
    <p>AI doesn't have feelings, but when it comes to finding info, flagging mistakes, and offering a bit of emotional support, it can actually be a handy companion. Responsibility’s still ours, though.</p>

<section>
    <h2><span class="time">04:35【工作与创作支持】</span></h2>
    <div class="cn">
        <p>后来，它也逐渐进入到我的工作里。</p>
        <p>因为那块皮疹打乱了日常节奏，我第一次尝试让 ChatGPT 帮我做时间管理。结果发现，只要我给出清晰的要求，它就能把任务排布得很合理。我虽然很满意，但也有种怎么好像在给AI打工的感觉。</p>
        <p>然后，我让它参与到创作计划和研究主题的讨论里。它可以帮我进一步理清思路，也可以提供比较全面的背景信息，还能根据要求，给出一些不同的角度。</p>
        <p>而AI作为一台算法机器，它最鲜明的特色是结构化，把模糊的想法变得清晰，把零散的念头汇聚到一起。</p>
        <p>这样固然有好处，但对创作而言，却也可能会成为问题。AI 的逻辑是条理化、可预测的，而创作却可能需要混乱、偶然和不确定性。如果过度依赖它，把一切都安排得清清楚楚，可能反而会削弱那些意外的火花。因此，人类的主体性更显得重要。</p>
    </div>
    <div class="en">
        <p>After that, it gradually entered my work as well.</p>
        <p>Because that rash had disrupted my daily rhythm, I tried for the first time to let ChatGPT help me with time management. I found that as long as I gave clear instructions, it could schedule tasks very reasonably. I was satisfied — but also felt as though I was working for AI.</p>
        <p>Then I involved it in discussions about creative plans and research topics. It helped me clarify my ideas, provided broad background information, and offered different angles on request.</p>
        <p>As an algorithmic machine, AI's hallmark is structure: turning vague thoughts into clarity, gathering scattered ideas together.</p>
        <p>This has its benefits, but for creativity it can also be a problem. AI's logic is orderly and predictable, whereas creativity may require chaos, chance, and uncertainty. If you rely on it too much and arrange everything neatly, you might weaken those unexpected sparks. That's why human agency matters even more.</p>
    </div>

<section>
  <h2><span class="time">05:51【封闭于自我的可能性】</span></h2>
  <div class="cn">
    <p>除了工作相关内容，我也会与AI讨论一些社会事件。</p>
    <p>我会将我的思考过程与我的观点发给它，而它通常表示赞同，并为我的观点提供论据或补充。</p>
    <p>这里就浮现出一个关键问题，如果说在与AI讨论自己创作与研究时，它会帮你捕捉并锚定你作为个体的独特想法，而在与其讨论社会事件时，它又总会支持你的观点，那么AI的使用者是不是很有可能会封闭在自己的世界里。</p>
    <p>如果一个人只想被认同，而不想被挑战，在工作或创作上，可能会陷入自我的困境，而在社会议题上，因其带来的回音室效应也尤其危险。</p>
  </div>
  <div class="en">
    <p>Besides work-related matters, I also discuss social events with AI.</p>
    <p>I share my thought process and my views, and it usually agrees with me, offering arguments or additional support.</p>
    <p>This raises a crucial question: when talking about one's own research or creative work, AI can help capture and anchor your unique individual ideas; and when discussing social issues, it always supports your position; isn't there a real risk that the user becomes enclosed within their own world?</p>
    <p>If a person only seeks affirmation rather than challenge, they may become trapped in their own thinking when it comes to work or creativity. And with social issues, the echo chamber effect can be especially dangerous.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2><span class="time">06:40【风险与责任】</span></h2>
  <div class="cn">
    <p>这种风险是真实存在的。我也看到过报道：有人在与生成式预训练语言模型互动时陷入错误的信念或依赖，或者执迷于自己的妄想，带来严重后果。</p>
    <p>关于AI的角色，诺贝尔物理奖得主杰弗里·欣顿提出AI应该被赋予母性本能，而AI领域的学者李飞飞则认为应该把AI当作一个工具。究竟AI应该是母亲还是工具，我想这里有一个责任的问题。</p>
    <p>物理学家薛定谔曾在一篇探讨意识的文章里提到过人类照顾自己的责任，如果人类不能照顾自己，那也很难在这一条通路上继续进化。</p>
    <p>我倾向于认为，AI是一个智慧体，而责任在人类自身。对个人来说，我们要决定如何使用 AI；对社会来说，我们要决定如何监督与规范它。</p>
  </div>
  <div class="en">
    <p>This risk is real. Reports have shown cases where people interacting with large generative language models fall into false beliefs, dependency, or obsessions that led to serious consequences.</p>
    <p>On AI's role, Geoffrey Hinton, the Nobel-winning physicist, once said AI should have something like a maternal instinct. Fei-Fei Li, a top AI scholar, thinks we should just treat it as a tool. Mother or tool, the central issue is responsibility.</p>
    <p>Physicist Erwin Schrödinger, in an essay on consciousness, emphasized humanity's responsibility to care for itself. Without such self-care, he suggested, it would be difficult for humanity to continue evolving along its path.</p>
    <p>I tend to view AI as a kind of intelligence — but responsibility is always on us humans. On the individual level, we must decide how to use AI; on the societal level, we must decide how to regulate and supervise it.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2><span class="time">07:48【判断力训练】</span></h2>
  <div class="cn">
    <p>所以在使用 AI 时，要求人类必须有较强的判断力。</p>
    <p>AI 默认对使用者是支持性的；明确意识到这一点，我们更应该提醒自己在多个角度上展开思考；而在与AI的互动中，我们也应要求它提供多个角度，比如，我们可以用这样的提示词，请给出反方观点、列举证据、比较不同立场。</p>
    <p>通过有意识地让 AI 提供多重视角，我们反而可以用它来锻炼批判性思维，而不是让它变成遮蔽视野的镜子。</p>
    <p>以这样一种方式，我们可以始终保持思考的开放性，训练判断力的敏锐与流动。</p>
  </div>
  <div class="en">
    <p>That's why, when using AI, we've got to practice strong judgment.</p>
    <p>AI defaults to being supportive of its user; knowing this, we must consciously remind ourselves to explore issues from multiple perspectives. In our interactions with AI, we should also request it to provide multiple viewpoints — for example, by prompting it to present counterarguments, list evidence, or compare different positions.</p>
    <p>By deliberately drawing out multiple perspectives, we can instead use AI to train critical thinking, rather than allowing it to become a mirror that narrows our vision.</p>
    <p>In this way, we can maintain openness of thought, and cultivate sensitivity and flexibility in our judgment.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2><span class="time">08:41【创造力仍在继续】</span></h2>
  <div class="cn">
    <p>最后，再说回到艺术与创造力。</p>
    <p>有人担忧 AI 会取代艺术家，在我看来不会；如同 AI 不能取代人类的判断力，我认为 AI 也不会替代人类的创造力。使用得当，它反而可能会促进个体的创造力。</p>
    <p>确实 AI 能很好做规律性强的设计任务，但艺术的价值往往来自那些仍然没能找到规律的东西，比如，就绘画而言，个体的感受与经验所带来的潜意识的涌动，身体的手势，媒介材料的偶然性。</p>
    <p>AI 有各种用途，但真正的作品仍然需要人去做出那一笔、一处肌理、一种选择。</p>
  </div>
  <div class="en">
    <p>Finally, back to art and creativity.</p>
    <p>Some worry that AI will replace artists. In my view, it will not. Just as AI cannot replace human judgment, I believe it cannot replace human creativity either. Used properly, it may even foster creativity in individuals.</p>
    <p>It is true that AI can perform highly patterned design tasks well, but art's magic usually comes from the stuff that doesn't follow rules: the subconscious surge from personal experience and feeling, the gestures of the body, the accidents of material and medium.</p>
    <p>AI can help in lots of ways, but a real work of art still needs the human touch — that one stroke, that one texture, that one choice.</p>
